### Group Reflection Prompts:

Here are the four prompts I want you to submit after each problem set
is due, and suggestions for the lengths for those sections. I'm
emphasizing quality over quantity, so be concise and to the point,
focusing on the most critical aspects of their collaboration.

1. **Group Dynamics**:
   - How did your (problem set) group collaborate this week? Describe the overall dynamics and any specific challenges or successes.
   - Students should provide a concise overview of the group's
     collaboration for the week, highlighting any specific challenges
     or successes.
   - **Approximate Length**: 50-100 words.

2. **Individual Contributions**:
   - Briefly outline what each group member, including yourself, contributed to this week's problem set.
   - Brief descriptions of each member's contributions are sufficient.
     For a group of three, this section would total around 90-150
     words.
   - **Approximate Length**: 30-50 words per group member.

3. **Feedback for Group Members**:
   - For each group member, including yourself, provide constructive feedback. Highlight strengths and suggest areas for improvement.
   - Feedback should be constructive, highlighting strengths and
     suggesting areas for improvement. For a group of three, this
     section would total around 120-180 words. THESE WILL BE SHARED
     AMONG THE GROUP MEMBERS
   - **Approximate Length**: 40-60 words per group member.

4. **Improvement Plans**:
   - Based on this week's collaboration, what specific steps will you take to enhance teamwork in the next session?
   - The student should outline specific steps or strategies this
     student will adopt for better collaboration in future sessions.
   - **Approximate Length**: 50-100 words.


### Sample Group Reflection:

As an example, consider the below sample reflection. It provides a
clear overview of the group's collaboration, individual contributions,
and plans for improvement. It's constructive and focuses on both
strengths and areas for growth.

**Group Dynamics**:
Our group had a productive session this week. We divided the problems among ourselves initially but came together to discuss and finalize solutions. One challenge we faced was aligning our schedules for an additional meeting outside of class, but we managed to find a common time.

**Individual Contributions**:
- **Dwayne**: Dwayne took the lead as we worked on problems related to lists. He also provided valuable insights during our group discussions, helping us optimize a couple of solutions.
- **Gwendolyn**: Gwendolyn was instrumental in developing better test cases. She has a keen eye for detail and caught several minor errors that could have cost us points. She also led the effort on string-related problems.
- **Myself**: I was leading on problems that required data manipulation, and I was double checking the assignment description to ensure we didn't miss any points.

**Feedback for Group Members**:
- **Dwayne**: Strengths: Strong analytical skills and a deep understanding of array operations. Areas for Improvement: Could benefit from more active communication during the initial problem-solving phase.
- **Gwendolyn**: Strengths: Excellent debugging skills and attention to detail. Areas for Improvement: Might consider exploring alternative solutions before settling on one, to ensure optimization.
- **Myself**: Strengths: Organized approach and effective note-taking. Areas for Improvement: Need to brush up on some foundational concepts to contribute more effectively to problem-solving.

**Improvement Plans**:
For our next session, I'm going to suggest a brief brainstorming phase for each problem, ensuring everyone's on the same page. I will also spend more time preparing outside of class.
