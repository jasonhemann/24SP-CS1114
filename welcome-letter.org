Hi,

First of all let me say welcome to CSAS1114 this semester! I'm excited to introduce you to the world of computer programming. I want to hit the ground running. Before class begins please:

1. Read the course syllabus. (The course home page is linked from Canvas)
2. Consult the schedule page of the course website:
   Read the first 45 pages of the course textbook. It will be up to you to keep up with this.
3. Download and install the DrRacket software v. 8.10 https://racket-lang.org/
   You should be able to open and run the attached file; the run button should produce a big green 120.
4. Be prepared for a preliminary quiz at the beginning of class on Monday morning!
5. If you want, you can get started right away on our first assignment.
