# LSP8 - "Aliens Attack v.8"

## Assignment: 

You have one task in this assignment. You must add to your client's
display, in the lower left hand corner, outside of the play area, a
small box that has on the left the player's color, and on the right
the player's current score. Remember that in this version of "Aliens",
only the server updates the state of the world. You may find it easier
to gently fit this in through Aliens 6 and 7 before attempting this in
Aliens 8. But I will only ask you to submit, and will review with you,
your version from Aliens 8.
