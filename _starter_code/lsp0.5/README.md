# Aliens Attack v.0

I had intended to offer this assignment for students, for submission
and for credit.

I had actually failed to do so as an independent assignment, so I'll
skip it for this year.

The students had three tasks for this assignment.

## Task 1.

Implement Aliens Attack v.0 as described in "Animated Problem Solving"

## Task 2.

Implement your own version of ROCKET-IMG, ALIEN-IMG, and SHOT-IMG.
These should be non-trivial definitions. That is, like Marco, yours
should require some Use those instead of the ones that Marco gave us
in the textbook. Make sure and follow the design recipe as you
implement it.

## Task 3.

Complete Ex. 54 from the textbook using your new implementations of
ROCKET-IMG, ALIEN-IMG, and SHOT-IMG.
