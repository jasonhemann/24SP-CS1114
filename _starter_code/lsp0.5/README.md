# Aliens Attack v.0

You have three tasks for this assignment.

## Task 1.

Implement Aliens Attack v.0 as described in "Animated Problem Solving"

## Task 2.

Implement your own version of ROCKET-IMG, ALIEN-IMG, and SHOT-IMG.
These should be non-trivial definitions. That is, like Marco, yours
should require some use of the image library to create your images out
of combinations of those elements. So, do not just use the ones that
Marco gave us in the textbook, and do not (merely) use pictures you
downloaded from the internet. Make sure and follow the design recipe
as you implement it.

## Task 3.

Complete Ex. 54 from the textbook using your new implementations of
ROCKET-IMG, ALIEN-IMG, and SHOT-IMG.
