You have three tasks in this assignment:

1. Implement "Aliens Attack v.1" as described in Ch.6 "Animated
Problem Solving", ยง35 - end of chapter.

2. Redesign your solution to "Aliens Attack v.1" so that, when your rocket is in the rightmost column and your program receives a right arrow key, the rocket moves to the leftmost column. Similarly, when your rocket is in the leftmost column and your program receives a left arrow key, the rocket moves to the rightmost column. (Hint: you will need to use the modulo operator.)

3. Redesign your solution to "Aliens Attack v.1" so that the rocket moves three spaces at a time on each right or left arrow key press. You may or may not need to revisit your solution to #2 to accomplish this.

I only need your complete solution after having accomplished all three.
