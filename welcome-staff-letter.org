Hi you all,

Thanks for agreeing to TA 1114 this semester. I'm looking forward to getting to work with you all. Please do me several favors:

1. If you have not already (Abby, Tijana), please fill this in:
https://www.when2meet.com/?20920460-NoE1i when you will be regularly
available during the week.

We will have a regular meeting at a regular time, so I can go through
with you all what I'll be doing the following week. About an hour.

This will keep you ahead of the students for homework, etc---anything
I'm doing that you haven't done before.

If it looks like we are having trouble finding a common meeting time,
prepared to find some more available times; worst case we can meet on
the weekend. I will send out an announcement when I have a meeting time.

2. Please give me your github.com username. If you do not have one, go
   make one, and then give me your username. I will add you to our
   course website github repository.

   When you receive the email that you are added, please add your
   information to the file, including your office hours dates and times

   https://github.com/jasonhemann/23FA-CS1114/blob/master/_data/personnel.yaml

3. Please read the syllabus on the course website. Please submit to
   me, in an email, your hand-written solutions to the syllabus-reading-quiz.
