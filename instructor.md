# More about me.

You can find out more about me via my website, at the root of this same domain.

# Contact

For asynchronous communications, it's generally best to get me by [email]({{ site.baseurl }}/syllabus/#contact).

Normally I will not check or respond to Teams messages sent outside of
office hours. During this period you can feel free to call or message
if you cannot be in the office.

# Office Hours Location and Format

Office hours location and format are listed on the [people]({{ site.baseurl }}/people/). In
addition to my in-person office hours, I am also on teams for that
period. Just call.
