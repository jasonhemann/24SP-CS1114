## Purpose and Objectives

{{ site.title }} course syllabus. All students must abide by the
policies and expectations laid out here; failure to do so may cost you
the opportunity to continue in the course. I reserve the right to
amend these policies and expectations at any time; notice of such
changes will be made by email, in-class announcement, or by direct
change to the course website. In this course we'll adopt a flipped
classroom approach, emphasizing hands-on problem-solving, group
collaboration, and individual accountability.

### Course Goals

1. Develop problem-solving ability.
2. Apply programming skills in a modern language and development environment.
3. Practice assessment and evaluation through testing and specification.
4. Apply abstraction and abstract thinking.
5. Develop familiarity with modern computer technology.
6. Reinforce basic mathematics and logic skills

## Coursework expectations / Flipped Class

This semester I will "flip" half the classes. That is to say, you will
spend 1/2 of your in-class time working together in groups on problem
sets. Lecture once a week will *not* entirely prepare you for your
assignments. You *must* read assigned textbook material, and you
*must* watch assigned videos in order to stay abreast with the class.

## General Class Schedule

- **Mondays**: Instructional sessions and Q&A.
- **Wednesdays**: Group problem-solving "open group work" sessions.

## Contact

- Personal, private (FERPA, etc) messages: [{{ site.author.emailaddr }}]({{ site.author.email }}). You should expect a response within 48 hours.

A great regular way to reach out for help is via our [office hours]({{ site.baseurl }}/office-hours/).

## Textbooks

- Primary textbook [Animated Program Design](https://rd.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-85091-3) by Marco T. Morazán
- Ancillary textbook [How to Design Programs, 2nd Edition](https://htdp.org/2022-8-7/Book/index.html)

(This latter text is freely available online at the above URL)

## Grading Breakdown

- **Problem Sets**: 40%
- **Problem Set Group Reflections**: 5%
- **Quizzes**: 30%
- **Large Software Projects**: 20%
- **Tutoring Attendance**: 5%

## Course Components

### 1. **Problem Sets**

- Assigned every **Wednesday**.
- Due **Thursday evening**.
- Each student submits their own solution.
- I will check (possibly a subset of the) problems to ensure understanding and correctness.
- These will measure correctness of design and structure, as much as correctness of implementation.

### 2. **Problem Set Group Reflections**

- Submitted alongside problem sets.
- Please see the [reflection page]({{ site.baseurl }}/reflection/) for more details.

### 3. **Quizzes**

- Daily (or weekly, TBD) at the start of the class.
- Duration: 10 minutes.
- Paper and pencil quizzes. Be prepared and bring a pencil.
- Content based on recently assigned reading material and/or videos.
- Cannot be made-up or retaken
- I will drop the lowest 5

### 4. **Large Software Project**

- Textbook-based projects based upon the game developed in "Animated Problem Solving"
- Pair programming encouraged
- Different extensions assigned to different groups.
- Oral examination at some point(s) in the semester

#### Oral Assessments

At some points in the semester, after one of these large software
projects is due, you, as an individual, may be (randomly or not)
selected to come to give an oral code walk of your submission. You
will schedule a time to meet mee at my office within 48 hours to
present and explain your submission. You will be responsible for all
the software that your group submitted in that assignment, including
any starter code. You will need to explain how it works and why it was
designed that way. If you are so requested, this will account for 20%
of your grade on the project. If you are working in a group, this will
account for 20% of your group's grade on the project.

## Problem Set Group

Working with other developers is an important skill. No modern
software is developed alone, without interface with the broader
community. You will work in groups, selected by me, of no more than
four to complete these problem answer sets.

### Homework Quizzes

Throughout the course of the semester you will have some more sizable
homework assignments. I expect you to work in a pair, and I will
assign credit to the pair. I will assign a grade to the pair, based
upon your code and an oral examination at my office.

You will generally have two weeks to complete these assignments.

### Tutoring Attendance/Practice Problems

I have asked our tutors to ensure that you attend tutoring at least
once per week.

- If I assigned practice problems that are not otherwise graded, they
will ask to see your progress on these, and give you credit for
partly/mostly attempting them.
- I may ask you to go by and demonstrate your knowledge and
understanding of some concept.
- Otherwise demonstrate your progress on a current or upcoming assigment or ask for help and clarification.


## Class Participation

Attendance is mandatory, but not sufficient. I will ask that you stay
on topic and pay attention during lectures. If I or my TAs see that
you are drifting, we will ask you to close your phone or laptop, and
take paper notes.


## Course Evaluation

Through most of the semester, I do work for your benefit, and you pay
me for it. Once, at the end of the year the university schedules
evaluations---intended to benefit me, your future colleagues, and the
university as a whole---over a time in the semester in which you have
a large amount of work and little time to do it. When you do work for
my benefit, I should pay you. To that end, if at least 85% of the
course submits an evaluation, I will add one GPA point to the overall
course average. I find the qualitative written feedback to be much
more actionable and granular than the quantitative top-line numbers,
but both are valuable. These are anonymous and asking for your candid
assessment.

## Technology and Platforms

We will use a variety of tools and platforms to facilitate teaching
and learning over the semester. Please see the [technology page]({{ site.baseurl }}/tech/) for more details.

## Academic Integrity

Misrepresentation of someone else's work as one's own is a grave
violation of academic ethics.

**Cheating** -- n. copying or submitting as your own, with or without
consent, someone else’s work as your own.

This includes, but is not limited to:
- copying from someone else answers to questions during an exam
- copying programs from internet sources
- collaborating with other students on individual assignments
- collaborating with individuals outside your group on group assignments

**Plagiarism** -- n. using someone else’s work in your own and not
properly crediting the authors of that work.
This includes, but is not limited to:

- adapting someone else's code to solve a problem or write a program.

There will be no tolerance for cheating and plagiarism in this course.
Any material that is not entirely your own work (or your group's work,
when applicable).

When in doubt, ask your instructor. Violations of academic integrity
will lead to a score of zero on the offending assignment and likely an
immediately failing grade for the course.

## DSS
